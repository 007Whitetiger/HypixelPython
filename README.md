> The overriding design goal for Markdown's

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Tech

Dillinger uses a open source project to work properly:

* Requests: Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily.

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/007Whitetiger/HyPy)
 on GitHub or install it via Pypi.

### Installation

HyPy requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) v3+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

# windows:

```sh

# For development options:
