Dillinger uses a open source project to work properly:

* Requests: Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily.

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/007Whitetiger/HyPy)
 on GitHub or install it via Pypi.

HyPy requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) v3+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

# windows:

```sh

# For development options:
